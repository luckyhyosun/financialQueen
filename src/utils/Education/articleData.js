            "The past few decades have seen tremendous strides towards true equality for women — but there’s still work to be done. Women in Europe earn 12.7% less than their male counterparts. They’re more likely to experience on-the-job discrimination, and to work in industries where their work is underpaid. They’re also, on average, less financially literate than men.",

            "When it comes to securing and maintaining financial well-being into later life, women face greater challenges than men. Because women report being less knowledgeable about finances compared to men, many consider financial education to be key to eliminating these gender wealth disparities. Even among younger generations, we find that women underperform men on tests of financial knowledge. Exactly how this occurs remains an open question. Is it that women indeed know less than men in the domain of finance? Or is it that they simply lack experience or delegate responsibility for major financial decisions to someone else? Or is it that women feel less confident so that their performance on tests of financial knowledge reflect uncertainty or doubt more than competence or ability? Knowing the answers to these questions can illuminate behaviors underlying gender wealth inequalities."

They want to invest in their children’s and grandchildren’s futures to provide them with financial stability and better educational opportunities. But, getting there is challenged by racial wealth gaps and cultural barriers. The Hispanic and Latina racial wealth gap continues to widen, leaving women and their families more financially vulnerable and with fewer opportunities. By the first quarter of 2024, Hispanic families had only 19 cents for every dollar that white families had, meaning that, on average, they were $1.1 million behind.",
